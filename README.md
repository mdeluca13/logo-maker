## Description

Logo Maker is a Node.JS program that creates a SVG logo based on user input. As a web developer, logos are needed for the sites that are being developed. This program allows you to create a logo based on your preference of color, shape and initials. 

I was able to demonstrate what I have learned throughout the Carleton University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp as well as use my researching skills to determine how SVG files work, and how to manipulate them to have them work with the Logo Maker program. 

## Installation

You will need to install [node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to run the Logo Maker. 

You will also have to install through the package.json file: 

- [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4)
- [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)

This can be done through npm install in your Node.js Terminal.

## Usage

1. When node index.js is run through the terminal, this will initialize the program.
2. You will be prompted with a series of questions including characters to include, text colour, logo shape, and logo shape colour. 
3. Once all questions are answered, you will find "Enjoy your Logo!" in your Node.JS terminal. 
4. You can then view your new logo in a browser.
